Makibox A6 Firmware - Virtual COM Port based USB Comms
======================================================

Makible is working on a new USB comms protocol - on the main / default branch.

This fork uses the virtual COM port USB comms that most of the existing tools 
(e.g. Pronterface) interface to. This will allow the use of existing software 
tools such as Pronterface until a set of new tools are developed and tested 
to work with the new USB comms protocol.
