Makibox Firmware
================

This is the firmware that powers the Makible printers (currently, the Makibox
A6).  It is based on the Sprinter firmware for RepRap-derivative controllers,
which is itself based on the Tonokips firmware.

Makibox A6 Firmware - Virtual COM Port based USB Comms
======================================================

Forking off so that old virtual COM port USB comms tools (e.g. Pronterface) can 
be used for testing. USB protocol edits can then be done independently without 
holding up development and testing on other parts.

NOTE:
This fork will (most likely) not be officially supported by Makibox / Makible 
going forward in the future. It will be left here for those who wish to develop 
it further or wish to use their Makibox A6 with Pronterface and other 
pre-existing software tools that require the use of USB virtual COM port 
communications.
